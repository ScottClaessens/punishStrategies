I did not see any need to take money out of spite when they had done nothing to me (as again it would cost me and I would gain nothing and they had done nothing.) I did though feel that the person who took money from another out of spite (in the context of this test not real spite) did need to have that behavior balanced out so chose to take someback (paying to do so.) Lastly where we randomly had been allocated different amounts I did think it fair to balance that out to make it equal. First impression decisions not deeply thought through on each but certainy given initial thought. If everyone attacks everyone else to an extent everyone loses is my thought basis here.
