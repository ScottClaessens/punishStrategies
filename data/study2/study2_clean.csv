Now, if I were playing several rounds against the same player, it might make sense to do so in order to discourage them from taking my money, but for a one-shot kind of deal, it makes more sense to conserve my money.

On the other hand, when I have the choice whether to take someone's money or not, I think it's less risky to play nice and stay out of the way rather than risk retaliation. I reckon that most people care more about their emotions and status and stuff than they do about money and the future, and wouldn't think twice about throwing away a dime just to satisfy some primal urge. On the other hand, except for the occasional psychopath here and there, most people probably wouldn't retaliate if there were nothing to retaliate against, especially if the other player (ie me) started with 30c compared to their 70c.",66,69,71,25,76,55,0,0,47,82,2,Yes,NA,2023-06-27T17:46:42Z,2023-06-27T17:56:14Z,100,571,TRUE,2023-06-27T17:56:15Z,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,3 - Slightly oppose,1 - Strongly oppose,7 - Strongly favour,7 - Strongly favour,5 - Slightly favour,2 - Somewhat oppose,6 - Somewhat favour,7 - Strongly favour,"85

In the question that was (if I remember correctly) a player choosing to take .20 from me to make it .50-.70 instead of .70 to .50, I figured neither of us really deserves the .70 more so punishing them (also at a cost to myself) wouldn't really be beneficial to either of us or the principle of fairness, since the scenario was necessarily unfair to begin with with neither of us at fault. Them choosing to have the unfairness on their side doesn't bother me, and I don't think they're in the wrong for doing so. For the arbiter question, I decided to spend .10 to punish the player if they choose to take from the other, as their bonuses were already equal before them taking anything, and I think selfish behavior like this at the cost of someone else should be discouraged. In this scenario, I also still receive 90% of my bonus which is hardly losing anything from the 100%, and I don't feel guilty with my choice, so it seemed like an overall quite good option.",100,0,0,79,71,64,0,0,0,6,0,Other (please explain),"I know experiments like this frequently are deceptive and don't have real participant interaction so I was slightly skeptical but generally belived (maybe 75%) that I was interacting with real people.
