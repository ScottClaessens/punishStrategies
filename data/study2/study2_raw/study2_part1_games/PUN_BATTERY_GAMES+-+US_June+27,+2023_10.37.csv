Now, if I were playing several rounds against the same player, it might make sense to do so in order to discourage them from taking my money, but for a one-shot kind of deal, it makes more sense to conserve my money.

On the other hand, when I have the choice whether to take someone's money or not, I think it's less risky to play nice and stay out of the way rather than risk retaliation. I reckon that most people care more about their emotions and status and stuff than they do about money and the future, and wouldn't think twice about throwing away a dime just to satisfy some primal urge. On the other hand, except for the occasional psychopath here and there, most people probably wouldn't retaliate if there were nothing to retaliate against, especially if the other player (ie me) started with 30c compared to their 70c.",66,69,71,25,76,55,0,0,47,82,2,Yes,,5febf3346a3657d4aca47a2f,6,6491644621d8d61e03149626,64918336010f759f43ea79d8

To give any of the money back to the researchers (as much as I love all researchers!!!) is just bad form.  In game 7 my motivation was to act in the way that would be less likely to compel Player 1 to give back some of the bonus pot.  I'm figured I'm going to come out on short end in that game but I feel good about it and don't expect Player 1 to spend .10 to fine me .30 since I didn't take anything from them.

As far as Game 1 is concerned, I definitely didn't like the idea of Player 2 taking from Player 1 but that's on their conscience.  I'd rather have them sort that out between themselves and God than to beat them over the head with the big stick I carrying in that game.  If I did that then in my mind they wouldn't have the possible moment of clarity with their God that could lead to far better results for them.

Them choosing to have the unfairness on their side doesn't bother me, and I don't think they're in the wrong for doing so. For the arbiter question, I decided to spend .10 to punish the player if they choose to take from the other, as their bonuses were already equal before them taking anything, and I think selfish behavior like this at the cost of someone else should be discouraged.

So I'm not going to be vindictive just for revenge. Revenge is not good. If the person is a thief, then the person has a lot of issues in his/her life, and it's not worth my time to punish or get revenge. Let him/her have the money because eventually, his/her misdeeds will catch up, and he/she will be punished by life. It's not worth my peace of mind to get revenge.
